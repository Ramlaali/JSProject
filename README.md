# JSProject

For my project I created an Anime Quote generator that ouptus the charcter name, anime, and the quote.

I first made a random quote generator fetching the api 'https://animechan.vercel.app/api/random'.

From that same website I used the another api for my second Event Listener where it allows users to input an anime characters name and our function fetches a random quote from a charcter with that name and outputs it.

My last Event listener is a reload button that refreshes the page. 

Users can also output a random quote and a quote from the anime character on the same page.
